## How-to-Play

Double click on the index.html file and the game will launch on your default browser. On launch the playing field, bugs (enemies), and player will all render on the screen. There is a scoreboard to the left of the screen that will display the score, the number of lives remaining, and the number of seconds remaining. The player will receive 20 points every time the player character makes it to the water at the top without hitting, or getting hit by, any of the bugs. A collision with a bug will result in the loss of a life and the player character being returned to the starting position. When the player losses all three lives, the game is over. The player has 15 seconds to make it to the top of the playing field on each reset. Failure to do so will result in the loss of a life. After all lives are lost, the player will have the choice to play again or quit. Bug speed and relative initial position are randomized each game and by reloading the page.

None.

## To-Do

A menu with optional player models will be added in the future. Also an optional harder game mode will be added that will increase the speed of the bugs as the game continues.
